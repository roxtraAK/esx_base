- esx_society: Allows job resources to register a society, gaining employee management, society funds, and more
- esx_billing: Allows members of some societies to send fines or bills to other players
- esx_vehicleshop: Allow players to purchase vehicles from a dealership, or setup society support for a player-managed dealership
- esx_ambulancejob: Adds a death and respawn system while allowing players to work as EMS to heal and revive others
